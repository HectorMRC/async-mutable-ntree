A mutable n-ary tree with async support.

## About
This library provides a simple way to define, mutate and traverse trees of an arbitrary and non-constant arity. In addition, regarding to traversal algorithms, four different implementations are included: the mutable and immutable approaches, as well as the synchronous and asynchronous strategies for both of them.
